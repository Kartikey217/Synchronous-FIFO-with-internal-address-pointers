# Synchronous-FIFO-with-internal-address-pointers
This FIFO is a synchronous memory buffer with internal read/write addresses that update automatically. It stores and retrieves data sequentially, maintaining FIFO order without manual pointer control, and supports simultaneous synchronous read and write operations.
